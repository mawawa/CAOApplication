    <h2>Computer Architecture Vs Computer Organisation</h2>

        <h3>Coputer Architecture</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>The study of system attributes that have direct impact on the logical execution of a program.</li>
                <li>Relates to functionality, that is  what a computer does as seen by programmers.</li>
                <li>It defines instruction formats, instruction opcodes, registers and memory and the algorithm for
                controlling instruction exectution.</li>
            </ul>
    <p>
        Here are a few examples of of computer architecture. The instruction set. The number of bits used
        to represent variour types of data. I/O machnisms. The techniques for addressing memory. for Instance,
        It is an architectural issue that the computer will have a multiply instruction.
    </p>
        <h3>Computer Organisation</h3>
                <li>
                    Deals with the computer operational units and thier interconnection to realize
                    of implement the architectural specifications.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Also relates to the structure and the behaivor, that is how the computer does its work
                    and how the components interact.
                </li>
    <p>
        Here are a few examples of computer organisation. Control signals, the interfaces between computer and the
        peripherals and the memory technology used. For instance It is an organizational issue whether that instruction will
        be implemented by a special multiply unit or by a
        mechanism that makes repeated use of the add unit of the
        system.
