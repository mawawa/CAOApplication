  <h1>History Of Computing</h1>
  <h2>First Generation Computers : Vacuum Tubes</h2>
  <p>
    This computer is made of vacuum tubes, for digital logic and also memory. This computer was developed under
    the <b>Institute of Advanced Study IAS</b> by  <i>John Van Newman</i>. The computer consists of the following components.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Main Memory
    </li>
    <li>
      Central processing unit
    </li>
    <li>
      Input output
    </li>
    <li>
      System bus
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>
    The components of an IAS computer system
  </h3>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>
        Main Memory
      </b>
      <br>
      this component stores data and instruction in 4096 storage locations
      (called words)
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>
        Arithmetic Logic Unit(CA)
      </b>
      <br>
      This component is capable of performing operations on binary data
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>
        Control Unit(CC)
      </b>
      This component interprets the instructions in memory and causes them to
      be executed by fetching the from memory and executing them.
    </li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Registers</h3>
  <p>
    Both the <b>Control Unit</b> and the <b>Arithmetic Login Unit</b> contain registers
    defined a follows.
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <b>
        Memory Buffer Register(MBR)
      </b>
      <br>
      This buffer contains a word that is to be stored in memory or is to
      be sent to the IO unit.
    </li>

    <li>
      <b>Memory Address Buffer</b>
      <br>
      This buffer contains the address in memory of the word that is to be written into
      or read into the Memory Buffer Register.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Instruction Register (IR)</b>
      <br>
      This contains the 8 bit  opcode instruction being executed.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>
        Instruction buffer Register (IBR)
      </b>
      <br>
      This register holds the right hand instruction from a world in memory.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>
        Program counter (PC)
      </b>
      <br>
      This contains the address of the next instruction pair to be fetched from memory .
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>
        Accumulator(AC) and Multiplexer Quotient (MQ)
      </b>
      Holds the operands temporarily and the results from the ALU
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>The Second Generation Computers : Transistors</h2>

  <p>
    The transistor, which is smaller, cheaper &
    generates less heat replaced the vacuum tube but
    used the same way to construct computers
    <br>
    • Unlike the vacuum tube, which requires wires,
    metal plates, a glass capsule, and a vacuum, the
    transistor is a solid-state device, made from silicon.
    The second generation saw the introduction of more
    complex arithmetic and logic units and control units, the
    use of high- level programming languages, and the
    provision of system software with the computer

    • The size of main memory, in multiples of 210 36-bit
    words, grew from 2k (1k = 210) to 32k words, while the
    time to access one word of memory, the Memory Cycle
    Time, fell from 30 microseconds to 1.4 microseconds.
  </p>

  <h2>The Third Generation Computers: Integrated
    Circuits</h2>
  <p>
    A single, self-contained transistor is called a
    discrete component.
    • In the1950s and early 1960s, electronic equipment
    was composed largely of discrete components -
    transistors, resistors, capacitors, and so on.
    • These components were manufactured separately,
    packaged in their own containers, and soldered or
    wired together onto Masonite-like circuit boards,
    which were then installed in computers.
    <br>
    Whenever an electronic device called for a
    transistor, a little tube of metal containing a
    pinhead-sized piece of silicon had to be soldered
    to a circuit board.

    • The entire manufacturing process, from transistor
    to circuit board, was expensive and cumbersome
    because some computers would consist of about
    10000 transistors
    <br>
    Here, a computer consists of gates, memory cells,
    and interconnections among these elements.

    • The gates and memory cells are, in turn,
    constructed of simple electronic components, such
    as transistors and capacitors

    • A gate is a device that implements a simple
    Boolean or logical function
