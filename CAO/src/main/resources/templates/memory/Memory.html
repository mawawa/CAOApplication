        computer memory exhibits perhaps the widest range of
        type, technology, organization, performance, & cost of
        any feature of a computer system. Computer memory exhibits perhaps the widest range of

    <p>
        No single technology is optimal in satisfying the
        memory requirements for a computer system

        As a consequence, the typical computer system is
        equipped with a hierarchy of memory subsystems, some
        internal to the system (directly accessible by the
        processor) and some external (accessible by thE
        processor via an I/O module).

        Characteristics of memory
    </h2>
    <h4>
        Location
    </h4>
    <p>
        <b>Internal Memory</b> - It is mostly equated with main memory even though there are various kinds of internal
        memory.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>External Memory</b> - These are the peripheral storage devices, such as disk and tape.These unlike internal
        memory are
        accessible via the I/O controllers.
    </p>

    <h4>
        Capacity
    </h4>
    <p>
        Capacity can be categorized into two. Capacity that is used for internal memory and capacity that is used for
        external memory.
        For internal memory since it is usually smaller and therefore measured in bits. External memory is measured in
        bytes.

    <h4>Unit of transfer</h4>
    Transfer is done in words and these may vary according to the bus configuration.
