    <H1>Control Unit Operation and Micro Programmed control</H1>
    <h2>What is the Control Unit? </h2>
    <p>
        This is the component of the computer the controls the operation of the processor.
        <br>
        Sequencing: The control unit causes the processor to step
        through a series of micro-operations in the proper
        sequence, based on the program being executed.
        <br>
        Execution: The control unit causes each micro-operation
        to be performed.
        <br>
        <em>
            Clock:
        </em>
        <br>
        • This is how the control unit “keeps time.” The control unit
        causes one micro-operation(or a set of simultaneous micro-operations) to be performed for each clock pulse.
        • This is sometimes referred to as the processor cycle time, or the
        clock cycle time

        <em>
            The inputs are:
        </em>
        <b>Instruction register:</b>
        <br/>
        • The opcode and addressing mode of the current instruction are
        used to determine which micro-operations to perform during
        the execute cycle.
        <br/>
        <b>Flags:</b>
        • These are needed by the control unit to determine the status of
        the processor and the outcome of previous ALU operations.
        • For example, for the increment-and-skip-if-zero (ISZ)
        instruction, the control unit will increment the PC if the zero
        flag is set.

    <h2>
        Micro operations
    </h2>
    <p>
        The operation of a computer in executing a program consists of a sequence of instruction cycles. Each instruction
        cycle is made up of a number of smaller units. This smaller units are as follows:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>fetch</dt>
        <dd>This occurs at the beginning of an instruction cycle. It causes an instruction to be fetched from memory.</dd>
        <dt>indirect</dt>
        <dd>This occurs in-oder to fetch the operands. This step may occur depending on if the instruction fetched specifies
            it.
        </dd>
    </dl>
    <h2>The Fetch Cycle</h2>
    <p>
        The fetch cycles uses the following registers:
    </p>
    <dl>
        <dt>1. MAR</dt>
        <dd><b>Memory Address Register</b> - This register is connected to the address lines of the system bus.
            It specifies the address in memory for a read of write operation.
        </dd>
        <dt>2. MBR</dt>
        <dd><b>Memory Buffer Register</b> - This register is connected to the data lines of the system bus.
            It contains the value to be stored in memory or the last value read from memory.
        </dd>
        <dt>3. PC</dt>
        <dd><b>Program Counter</b> - This holds the address of the next instruction to be fetched.</dd>
        <dt>4. IR</dt>
        <dd><b>Instruction Register</b> - This register holds the last instruction fetched.</dd>
    </dl>
    <h3><em>The fetch cycle from the view of the computer</em></h3>
    <p>
        In the beginning of the fetch cycle, the PC hold the address of the next instruction. So firstly is
        to move the address from the PC to the MAR seeing as it has access the address lines of the
        system bus. Once that is done the control unit issues a <em>READ</em> command on the control bus,
        and thus the data in the memory address held by the MAR is copied from memory to the MBR through
        the data lines of the system bus. After that we update the PC for the next instruction by <em>incrementing.</em>
        these actions do not interrupt each other and thus are do simultaneously. Lastly the contents in the MBR are
        moved to the IR, freeing up the MBR awaiting other uses like and indirect cycle.
    </p>
