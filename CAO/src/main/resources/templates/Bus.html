    <h1>Bus structure and inter connection structures</h1>
    <p>
        A computer consists of a set of components or
        modules of 3 basic types (processor, memory, I/O)
        that communicate with each other
        • In effect, a computer is a network of basic modules.
        – Thus, there must be paths for connecting the modules.
        • The collection of paths connecting the various
        modules is called the interconnection structure
        – The design of this structure will depend on the exchanges
        that must be made among modules
    </p>
    <h3>Bus Structure</h3>
    <p>
        – A bus is a communication pathway connecting two or
        more devices.
        – A key characteristic of a bus is that it is a shared
        transmission medium.
        <br>
        • Multiple devices connect to the bus, and a signal transmitted by
        any one device is available for reception by all other devices
        attached to the bus
<br>
        – If two devices transmit during the same time period, their
        signals will overlap and become garbled. Thus, only one
        device at a time can successfully transmit
        <br>
        on any bus the lines can be classified into three
        functional groups: <b> data, address, </b>and <b>control lines</b>
    </p>
    <h4>
        Data lines
    </h4>
    <p>
        The data lines provide a path for moving data among
        system modules. These lines, collectively, are called the
        data bus
        <br>
        • The data bus may consist of 32, 64, 128, or even more separate
        lines, the number of lines being referred to as the width of he
        data bus
        <br>
        • Because each line can carry only one bit at a time, the number
        of lines determines how many bits can be transferred at a time
    </p>

    <h4>
        Address lines
    </h4>
    <p>
        The address lines are used to designate the source or
        destination of the data on the data bus
        <br>
        • For example, if the processor wishes to read a word (8, 16, or
        32 bits) of data from memory, it puts the address of the desired
        word on the address lines.
        <br>
        • Clearly, the width of the address bus determines the maximum
        possible memory capacity of the system
        <br>
        • Furthermore, the address lines are generally also used to
        address I/O ports
